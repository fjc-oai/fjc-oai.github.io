My name is Jiacheng Feng. I work on distributed model infra at OpenAI. I used to be an engineer manager at Facebook working on distributed systems.

I like debugging and getting to the bottom of the problem. I believe inner happiness comes from self-sacrifice. I want to be part of something big (at least tried).
