I joint Meta since March 2015. It has been 8 years, a place longer than anywhere else I ever stayed. It's been an amazing ride. I got opportunities to work with talent people and solve challenging problems. I had a great memories and those memories are etched in my mind.

Some highlights
- Operated the world's biggest distributed system, i.e. newsfeed backend, and presented the work to the company.
- Crafted a top-tier recommendation engine, that powers the most critical prodcuts at Facebook. 
and building a team from scratch to excellence. Those memories are etched in my mind. It includes some wisdom I have learnt and still learning

Some wisdoms
- Have opinions. Form opinions about how things should be, to hard technical decisions, and also softer ones like cultural and behavioral ones.

- Develop a "oh, that's weird" sense. Have a mental model of how this thing should work, continuouly calibrate to either improve the mental model or correct misbehaviors.

- Ask yourself once a while, is the work really challenging? Glad it was yes many time. But I especially regret a year when I worked on a project that already understand what will happen, just to get a safer promo.


Some random thoughts
- EM: 1) set expectation, 2) give high quality feedback
