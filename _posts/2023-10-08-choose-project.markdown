Does working on hot domains accelerate career growth?

* Probably not if resources are boundless for all.
* In reality, hot domains present more impactful problems, lead to more opportunities, more resources, and more talented people.
* And a positive feedback loop!

Should one always chase for the hottest domain, e.g. AI, BlockChain?



* Various domains inherently share a common set of meta skills, though different domain knowledge.
* Meta skills shape an individual into a leader. Blindly chasing renders one a follower.

Does working on core xxx matter?

* Every project is challenging and impactful in its own ways, e.g. code quality, reliability, performance, etc.
* What truly counts is what interests you, the sense of, wow this is so cool.
