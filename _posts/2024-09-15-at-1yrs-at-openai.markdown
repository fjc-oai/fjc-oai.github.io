## Learnings
Looking back a year ago, I was still a n00b learning Transformer basics on Coursara. I'd rate my expertise as a 10. Over the past year I developed a comprehensive understanding of E2E training stack, and feel confidently to claim expertise in a few key areas. I rate myself 75 now. 


2023.10, LoRA perf: gained basic understanding of transformer, optimizer, microbatch.

2023.11, paper reading: read most (all?) major papers in distributed model training. 

2024.02, gradient accumulation: developed in-depth understanding into distributed training engine and core techniques.

2024.04, scale-up derisk: gained hands-on experience over much broader systems: ZeRO/FSDP, various sharding and pararallism, snapshot, quantization, etc.

2024.05, attention kernel: intial sense of kernel and triton.

2024.06, python: achieved fluency in Python at a level comparable to C++!

2024.07, tiny asyncio: deep understanding of routine and async. Resolved long standing questions around evb, select, sleep. Combined with my knowledge of folly::future, I claim myself an CPU parallel computing expert.

2024.07, tiny xxx engine: inside-out understanding of distributed training engine!


From don't know what don't know, to confidently work on unknowns.
From knows nothing n00b, to expert in a few areas.

## Experience
Witnessing history gave me my most valuable memories.
* o1 core contributor: be part of something big.
* Collaborating with talents. Those big names. Those people who made me realize the difference between intellence. And the great connections. 
* The privilege to not only witness but contribute to pushing the boundaries of human technologies.


## Next
Domain expert & innovation
* Become domain expert. Become go-to-person. Become the best in the world.
* Innovatation. From follower to leader

ML & product
* It's ML and product that eventually land impact on real world to millions of people.

Start-up
* Be part of sth big -> lead sth big (or at least tried)
* Connections
* Industrial trend. Take a leap of faith.


And lastly, the nice PPUs.
