# Super Engineer

- People often talk about “10x engineer”, but i feel like that’s kind of a misleading analogy.
- Some problems just can’t be solved by throwing more engineers at them
    - Creative thinking doesn’t parallelize 
    - Often times the communication overhead can easily outweigh the benefits of extra brainpower
- Scaling up vs scaling out
  - “The amount of scope that fits inside a single highly technical person’s brain is a natural complexity scale. If you push X substantially beyond this, things go bad quickly”
  - The cognitive capacity of that single person’s brain becomes the company’s upper bound
  - Super engineers shine at those life-or-death moment. they turn the tide single-handedly. .
- It seems a big and durable memory is a basic requirement for a super engineer, and clearly that’s something i don’t have
 
# People
- Learning from Avital: magical communication skills
    - Honestly, I still can’t pinpoint exactly what it is. Can’t even clearly pull out the rules yet - mostly i’m just mimicking
    - Be friendly. But don’t be overly polite. 
    - Be confident and have opinions.
    - Stay playful. Don’t take yourself, or us, too seriously.
    - Actually the more I try to describe it, the more off-trace it feels. I’d better stop here.
